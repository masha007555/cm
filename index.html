But think calmly and give a sign that you really wants me, ill wait for the situation with you and your cousins to get normal again for your message baka :) ill be back aroung 4:30 - 5:00 by tomorrow evening, if ill be late you can remember me by looking at your necklace ;) and please dont drink too much, try to have all the three times meal, and dare you do anything to yourself, ill not accept that. Dont think it as my last message, I promise ill be back to disturb you again tomorrow evening üòâ. I was trying to make a website just for us, with password protection and instent destroy website option for safety so you wont get caught, as there will be no notification sound or pop up, password protected,no need to download any app, and you can destroy the chat instently in any risky case. But i dont think i have time for that, if ill be back from tomorow's therapy then ill continue to work on it for us ;) till then dont find another pabo. Dont cry okay? take care, I REALLY LOVE YOU SO MUCH CUPCAKE ‚ù§Ô∏è");
